Pre Flop

Actions:
 - Fold (-Amount Spent)
 - Call (Move on, if you're not the small blind)
 - Raise (Opponent's Move)
*Opponent has similar choices. Track the amount of $ put in by both players.*
*There might be a limit to # of raises per round?*

Flop (3 cards revealed)
*For each combination of 3 cards, create a branch.
*So each branch is a combination of 3 cards and some pot size

Actions:
 - Fold (-Accumulated Amount Spent)
 - Call (Move on, if not the first person)
 - Raise (Opponent's Move)
*Opponent has similar choices. Track the amount of $ put in by both players.*
*There might be a limit to # of raises per round?*

Turn (4th card revealed)
*A branch for each possible 4th card revealed
**Again, the same thing

River (5th card revealed)
*A branch for each possible 5th card revealed
**Again, the same thing

At this point, evaluation. Player with the better hand wins and gets the money in the pot
